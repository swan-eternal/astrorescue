# Astro-Rescue

> **Status (2026-07-06):** Core gameplay loop working end-to-end — land on home planet, take off, transfer between planets via gravity, rescue astronaut, return home, win/lose flow all functional. Sun collision implemented (`is_landable` flag + `radius` @export); moons and asteroids are body types alongside sun and planet (level_01 uses all four). **Moon refactor (uncommitted):** moons are now scene-tree children of their host planets (in JSON and at runtime), with orbit distance measured from the planet's **surface** — impossible to render a moon inside its planet. **21 commits ahead of origin/main**, not yet pushed. Working tree dirty: this doc's in-progress updates, the uncommitted moon refactor (`scripts/moon.gd` rewrite, `scripts/level_loader.gd` changes, `data/levels/level_*.json` bumped to v3).

## Concept

2D arcade game. Player starts landed on a home planet, launches with limited fuel, transfers between planets via gravity, rescues stranded astronauts, returns to base. Crash on high-speed planet impacts. Fuel pickups at intermediate bodies. Series of hand-crafted levels with rising difficulty.

## What's Complete

### Closed-form orbit + JSON-driven levels — refactor stages (5/5 + post-refactor)

**Stage 1** (`4a0df4d`) — Foundation:
- `scripts/orbit_calculator.gd` — pure-math helper. Static functions: orbital elements + t + central_mass → position/velocity. Kepler equation via Newton-Raphson (3 iterations), vis-viva velocity, world-frame rotation.
- `SaveState.current_level_number` — used by level routing.
- `data/levels/level_01.json` — initial level data.

**Stage 2** (`742e27d`) — Closed-form planet orbits:
- `scripts/planet.gd` rewritten to call `OrbitCalculator.compute_state(perihelion, aphelion, angle_of_aphelion, phase, GameTime.current, sun_mass)` in `_physics_process`. No more Euler integration.
- New @exports: `perihelion`, `aphelion`, `angle_of_aphelion`, `phase` (replaced `orbit_radius` + `initial_speed_multiplier`).
- `scripts/game_time.gd` — static class with `current`, `reset()`, `tick(delta)`. Bodies read `GameTime.current` without a Node reference.
- `level_controller.gd` calls `GameTime.reset()` in `_initialize()` and `GameTime.tick(delta)` in `_physics_process`. Time-warp works uniformly (8× warp → planets move 8× faster).
- `level_01.tscn` updated to use new @exports.

**Stage 3** (`5fde0e7`) — Shared `level.tscn` + JSON-driven loading:
- `scripts/level_loader.gd` — reads `data/levels/level_<n>.json` (n from `SaveState.current_level_number`), instantiates bodies from the `bodies[]` spec, configures the rocket's @exports. Per skill §1.5, @exports assigned AFTER `add_child` so the script is fully initialized.
- `scenes/level.tscn` — new shared scene with infrastructure only (LevelController, SunContainer, PlanetContainer, rocket placeholder with rocketCamera child, HUD, LevelLoader). No per-level bodies.
- Wired `SaveState.current_level_number` through `level_select._on_level_selected`, `main_menu._on_start_pressed`, `win_screen._on_restart_pressed`, `lose_screen._on_restart_pressed`. Fixes the hardcoded `'level_01.tscn'` Restart bug.
- `data/levels/level_02.json`, `data/levels/level_03.json` authored with circular orbits (positions match originals exactly, verified via Python port).

**Stage 4** (`defc6e0`) — Closed-form trajectory line:
- `scripts/trajectoryline_2d.gd` rewritten to use closed-form orbital mechanics instead of Velocity Verlet forward-sim. Forward-sim was drifting by ~80 world units after 5 seconds for an eccentric orbit (e=0.37) — closed-form is exact.
- New @export `ellipse_segments: int = 128` replaces the old `steps` + `step_dt`.
- New `_compute_elements_from_state(r, v, mu)` helper converts (r, v) to orbital elements so `OrbitCalculator.compute_state` can sample at any future time.
- Time markers preserved (t+5s, t+10s, t+15s along the orbit).
- Removed dead code: `_simulate_heliocentric`, `_planet_accel`, `_rocket_accel`, `_PlanetSim` inner class.
- `scenes/rocket.tscn` cleaned up: removed orphan `steps = 1500` and `step_dt = 0.1`, replaced with `ellipse_segments = 128`.

**Stage 5** (`02d98cd`) — Cleanup:
- Deleted `scenes/level_01.tscn`, `level_02.tscn`, `level_03.tscn` (obsolete, replaced by shared `level.tscn` + JSON).
- Fixed regression in `planettrajectoryline_2d.gd::_compute_orbit_markers` — was reading removed `orbit_radius` @export, now reads `perihelion`/`aphelion` and computes semi-major axis as their average.

**Post-refactor feature** (`c90542d`) — Trajectory modes:
- Renamed enum: `Mode { TRUE, ORBITAL }` → `Mode { ELLIPSE, PROJECTED }`.
- `ELLIPSE` mode: closed-form orbit. **Auto-switches to nearest planet orbit** when rocket is inside its SOI (Hill sphere × `soi_fraction`). No more manual toggle — happens automatically based on proximity.
- `PROJECTED` mode: forward-simulated trajectory under sun + every planet's gravity. Planet positions sampled via `OrbitCalculator.compute_state(planet's elements, GameTime.current + step_dt, sun_mass)` at each step (so planet motion is exact; only the rocket is numerically integrated). 300 steps × 0.05s = 15s of predicted path. Symplectic Euler.
- Time markers work in both modes. ELLIPSE: closed-form (exact on the orbital ellipse). PROJECTED: indices into the forward-simulated polyline.
- `scripts/hud.gd` updated to label modes as "ELLIPSE" / "PROJECTED" instead of "TRUE" / "ORBITAL".
- Renamed color @exports: `true_color` → `closed_form_sun_color`, `orbital_color` → `closed_form_planet_color`. New `projected_color` (light blue) for PROJECTED mode.
- New @exports for PROJECTED tuning: `projected_steps: int = 300`, `projected_step_dt: float = 0.05`.

### Loose-ends cleanup — 5 commits, head `88afd46`

A long debug session surfaced and fixed several init-order and `@export`-timing bugs that the refactor had masked. Each fix in its own commit for review:

**`1302eb9` — `fix(loader): apply_visual + spawn_dynamic_children + configure_rocket trim`**

Root cause: `planet._ready` built visuals and spawned children from `@export` values that `level_loader` was assigning AFTER `add_child` (skill §1.5). At `_ready` time those `@export`s were still defaults, so visual size/color used placeholders and astronaut/fuel children were never spawned. Fix: two new methods called explicitly by `level_loader` once `@export`s are set.

- `planet.apply_visual()` — rebuilds the Polygon2D color/shape from current `radius` / `color`. Fixes "all planets render as small default dots."
- `planet.spawn_dynamic_children()` — instantiates `Astronaut` and `FuelPickup` children based on `has_astronaut` / `has_fuel` flags. Fixes "no astronauts visible."
- `_configure_rocket` stripped to position/velocity only — game-wide physics live in `rocket.gd` `@export`s (paired with `4908453` below).

**`7931e51` — `fix(trajectory): bounds guard + lazy-init sun + PROJECTED-only markers`**

Three bugs in `trajectoryline_2d.gd` / scene init order:

- Out-of-bounds crash on Tab when `_simulate_projected` returned empty (`sun_mass <= 0` during early init). Manual if/elif clamp could produce `index = -1` then access `points[-1]`. Replaced with `clampi` + empty-guard.
- `_find_sun()` in `_ready` returned `null` — `trajectoryline._ready` runs before `LevelLoader._ready` (LevelLoader is a sibling that adds the sun). Lazy retry in `_process` caches the result on first success.
- Marker dots in ELLIPSE mode were fixed-time samples on the closed-form ellipse — clutter on top of the ellipse itself. Marker sampling is now PROJECTED-only.

**`c3e4541` — `fix(planet-orbit-line): sample elements directly, kill high-warp breathing`**

The derive-from-state approach computed `omega` (argument of periapsis) from `(r, v)` each frame, where `r` and `v` come from Newton-Raphson Kepler iteration with machine-epsilon precision. At low warp this is invisible; at 8× warp the per-frame `omega` wobble translated to a visible slow "breathing" pulse on the planet's orbit line.

Now reads the `@export` orbital elements (constants set from JSON) and samples `OrbitCalculator.compute_state` at evenly-spaced times around one period. The line is identical frame-to-frame modulo inspector edits to the elements themselves.

(Same derive-from-state pattern exists in `trajectoryline_2d.gd::_orbit_ellipse` for the rocket's ELLIPSE mode but masked by the rocket's own per-frame motion; left alone, can refactor if it ever visibly breathes.)

**`4908453` — `refactor(rocket): single source of truth + min_visual_scale`**

- Triple-source-of-truth: rocket physics (thrust, landing/crash thresholds, fuel) were settable in `rocket.gd` `@export`, `rocket.tscn` scene override, AND `level_NN.json` rocket section. Moved all game-wide physics into `rocket.gd` `@export`s. JSON rocket sections are now placement-only (`initial_position`, `initial_velocity`).
- Dropped dead `launch_speed` `@export` (declared + assigned from JSON, never read) from JSON, script, and scene.
- New `min_visual_scale` `@export` (default 1.5): rocket Polygon2D scales inversely with camera zoom, keeping on-screen size constant at `min_visual_scale × size` pixels. Visual-only — physics, collision, trajectory math unchanged.
- `call_deferred("_snap_to_home_planet")` — same init-order class as the trajectory fixes; rocket was stranded at `initial_position` instead of glued to the home planet.

**`88afd46` — `chore: trailing-newline cleanups + uid regeneration`**

Drive-by trailing-newline normalization across `audio_manager` / `main_menu`. Auto-generated `.uid` files for `game_time`, `level_loader`, `orbit_calculator` now tracked (Godot editor regenerates these for cross-script references; see TODO about whether `.gitignore` would be cleaner).

### Body-type expansion — sun collision + moons + asteroids — 4 commits

Post-refactor the world had two body types (sun, planet). The next stretch added the other two and made the sun actually crashworthy:

**`abc16e7` — `feat(sun): collision detection + is_landable flag (instant crash on touch)`**

Two additions to `scripts/sun.gd`: `radius: float = 200.0` (single source of truth for visible disk + collision radius — same pattern as `planet.gd`) and `is_landable: bool = false` (default for sun, default true for planets). The rocket's landing/crash branch in `rocket.gd::_physics_process` was refactored to read `nearest.get("is_landable") == false` instead of a hard-coded "is this the sun?" check — the generic flag is now the single decision point for landable vs. crash-on-contact.

**`700a40b` — `feat(bodies): add moon and asteroid body types`**

- `scripts/moon.gd` — orbits a host planet via closed-form Kepler with the host's mass as central body. `global_position = host_planet.global_position + state["position"]`, `velocity = host_planet.velocity + state["velocity"]`. Joins "attractors" — the rocket's gravity loop pulls on moons. Default mass 10 (small enough that moons perturb, not dominate). Default `is_landable = true` (set false in JSON for a hazard moon).
- `scripts/asteroid.gd` — sun-centered closed-form orbit, same math as planets. Default `mass = 0.0` — joins "attractors" so collision detection finds it, but the gravity loop reads zero and applies no force. Default `is_landable = false` — touching always crashes regardless of approach speed. Optional `has_fuel = true` spawns a fuel pickup orbiting the rock for risk/reward fuel.
- Both follow the planet init-order pattern: `add_child` → set @exports → call `apply_visual()` + `spawn_dynamic_children()` + `resolve_orbit()` (moon only).
- `scenes/moon.tscn`, `scenes/asteroid.tscn` — minimal scenes for each.
- `scripts/level_loader.gd` got `_instantiate_moon` and `_instantiate_asteroid` dispatch arms.

**`68bb4ba` — `fix(moon): host_planet lookup actually works + populate level 01`**

The moon's `resolve_orbit()` was matching `body.name` (the Node's scene-tree identifier, always `"planet"` from `scenes/planet.tscn`) instead of `body.body_label` (the @export set by the loader from JSON's `"name"` key). Renamed the lookup to `body.get("body_label") == host_planet_name`. Also added a moon entry to level_01 (Earth's moon, perihelion 25 / aphelion 35, gray).

**`6e65b69` — `chore: track newly generated .uid files + scenes`**

Godot auto-generates `.uid` files next to every `.gd` and `.tscn` for cross-script references. New `moon.tscn`, `asteroid.tscn`, and the corresponding `.uid` files were untracked. Added to git. (See TODO about whether to gitignore them instead.)

### Cross-cutting fixes — 3 commits, head `49193ea`

Bugs surfaced as the body types got fleshed out — mostly consistency between attractors and one dead-code removal.

**`32e3847` — `fix(sun): expose velocity Vector2 to prevent Vector2(null) crashes`**

The sun had no `var velocity` declaration (it sits at the heliocentric origin and never moves, so why bother?). But HUD, rocket, trajectory line, and moon code all read `body.get("velocity")` unconditionally on every attractor — when the rocket got close enough to the sun, the sun returned null and `Vector2(null)` crashed with "Nonexistent Vector2 constructor." Added `var velocity: Vector2 = Vector2.ZERO` to `scripts/sun.gd` for parity with planet/moon/asteroid. Pattern: when adding or extending an attractor body type, match the shared property contract, even for properties the new body doesn't physically need.

**`71ee6a3` — `refactor(planet): remove dead DEFAULT_SUN_MASS fallback`**

A fallback constant in `scripts/planet.gd` was never reached — sun mass comes from the sun node directly via `_find_sun_mass()`.

**`49193ea` — `fix(rocket): tighten astronaut pickup SFX scope`**

`play_astronaut_pickup()` was firing whenever the rocket landed near an astronaut, even outside the actual pickup radius. Moved the call inside the distance check, so only true pickups trigger the sound.

### Moon refactor — subordinate children + surface-relative orbit (uncommitted)

A focused architectural cleanup. Moons used to be top-level bodies in `data/levels/level_NN.json` with a `host_planet` string reference and a `resolve_orbit()` lookup that glued them to their host. Two problems with that:

1. The moon in level_01 was permanently **inside** the earth (earth radius 40, moon perihelion 25, aphelion 35). The math permitted it; nothing prevented the bug at authoring time.
2. The `resolve_orbit()` lookup matched `body.name` (the scene-tree identifier, always `"planet"` from `scenes/planet.tscn`) instead of `body.body_label` — fixed in commit `68bb4ba` but the bug class remained.

The fix makes moons scene-tree children of their host planet. `get_parent()` is the relationship; the body_label lookup is gone at the architecture level.

**`scripts/moon.gd`** — full rewrite:
- Dropped `host_planet_name` @export (no longer needed).
- Dropped the `resolve_orbit()` host lookup (no longer needed — parent is always there). Kept the name `resolve_orbit()` for the initial-position computation.
- `_ready()` caches `_host = get_parent()` and `_host_radius = float(_host.get("radius"))`. The loader sets the planet's @export BEFORE adding moons as children, so the cache captures the JSON value, not the default.
- `_physics_process` and `resolve_orbit()` offset orbit distance by `_host_radius`: `OrbitCalculator.compute_state(_host_radius + perihelion, _host_radius + aphelion, ...)`. The JSON's `perihelion`/`aphelion` are now distance from the planet's surface; the math stays in center-relative terms internally.
- Position is set as a LOCAL position — Godot auto-applies the parent's transform, no more manual `global_position = host_planet.global_position + ...`. Velocity is still world-frame for collision reads: `velocity = Vector2(_host.get("velocity")) + state["velocity"]`.

**`scripts/level_loader.gd`** — 6 edits:
- Removed `_instantiate_moon()` function and its `"moon"` arm in the dispatch `match`.
- Added `_instantiate_planet_moon(planet, spec)` that does `planet.add_child(moon)` + sets @exports + `apply_visual()` + `spawn_dynamic_children()` + `resolve_orbit()`.
- `_instantiate_planet()` loops over `spec.get("moons", [])` at the end and calls `_instantiate_planet_moon` for each. Same init-order pattern as before; no new pitfalls.
- Bumped version check from `2` to `3`. Top docstring and the body_label comment updated to drop the moon reference.

**Schema bump — v2 → v3:**
- `data/levels/level_01.json` — rewritten. Moon entry moved into earth's `moons[]` array. Orbit values re-tuned (perihelion 20, aphelion 30 from surface → 60–70 from earth center, well clear of earth radius 40).
- `data/levels/level_02.json` and `data/levels/level_03.json` — version bump only (neither had moons). `spec.get("moons", [])` returns `[]` for both, no other changes needed.

**Other effects:**
- The `68bb4ba` body_label lookup bug is gone at the architecture level (the lookup pattern no longer exists for moons).
- `PlanetContainer` now holds only planets and asteroids — moons are inside their planets. The `📦 PlanetContainer is misnamed` backlog entry is updated accordingly.
- The `🟡 Visual scale balance across body types` TODO is resolved — moon-vs-planet scale can't make the moon render inside the planet anymore.

## Architecture

### Autoloads (`project.godot`)
- `SaveState` (`scripts/save_state.gd`) — persistent game progress (`highest_level_completed`, `current_level_number`); saved to `user://save.json`
- `AudioManager` (`scripts/audio_manager.gd`) — music + SFX (menu + gameplay music, thruster loop, pickup SFX)

### Key Tuning Constants
- `G = 1.0` (universal gravitational constant for this project)
- Sun mass default: `4_000_000`
- Sun radius default: `200.0` (collision + visual disk, single source of truth)
- Sun `is_landable`: `false` (instant crash on contact)
- Planet mass default: `1000` (planets vary widely per level — earth is `10000`)

- Moon mass default: `10.0`
- Moon radius default: `6.0`
- Moon default `is_landable`: `true`
- **Moon `perihelion` / `aphelion` are distance from the planet's SURFACE**, not center — the moon script offsets by `parent.radius` internally. Authoring example: earth (radius 40) with moon perihelion 20 → moon orbits at 60 from earth center, 20 above the surface.
- Asteroid mass default: `0.0` (obstacle only, no gravity)
- Asteroid radius default: `8.0`
- Asteroid default `is_landable`: `false` (instant crash on contact)
- Rocket landing threshold: rel_speed ≤ `80.0` = land, > `150.0` = crash (in between = crash, "danger zone")
- Time warp levels: `[1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0]` (drives `Engine.time_scale`)
- Trajectory predictor (PROJECTED): 300 steps × 0.05s = 15s lookahead
- Planet orbit predictor: 64 segments analytical ellipse, sampled from `@export` orbital elements
- Hill-sphere SOI fraction: `0.5` (for auto-SOI detection in ELLIPSE mode)

Note: `sun.position` is **cosmetic** — orbital math treats scene origin as the sun regardless of the JSON value. The `-1, -3` only affects where the sun is drawn. The sun's `radius` and `is_landable` are optional in JSON — sensible defaults (`200.0` and `false`) are set in `sun.gd`'s @exports.

Body types: `sun`, `planet`, `moon`, `asteroid` — all implemented. **Moons are scene-tree children of their host planet** — both in JSON (nested as a `moons[]` array inside the planet's body entry) and at runtime (level_loader instantiates each as a `Node2D` child of the planet node, so `get_parent()` is the host). **Moon orbit distance is measured from the planet's SURFACE**, not its center — the moon script offsets by `parent.radius` internally so the OrbitCalculator math receives center-relative distances. Asteroids orbit the sun with `mass = 0` (no gravity, obstacle only).

## Scripts Index

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `scripts/orbit_calculator.gd` | Pure-math orbital elements → position/velocity (Kepler, vis-viva) |
| `scripts/game_time.gd` | Global game-time clock (static class) |
| `scripts/level_controller.gd` | Per-level logic, win/lose detection |
| `scripts/level_loader.gd` | JSON → scene. Dispatches sun/planet/asteroid top-level bodies; `_instantiate_planet` spawns each planet's `moons[]` as child nodes via `_instantiate_planet_moon`. Calls `apply_visual()` + `spawn_dynamic_children()` (+ `resolve_orbit()` for moons) on each body, configures rocket position/velocity. Schema version checked: `v3`. |
| `scripts/trajectoryline_2d.gd` | Rocket trajectory: ELLIPSE (closed-form, auto-SOI) or PROJECTED (forward-sim). Bounds guard + lazy sun init. |
| `scripts/planettrajectoryline_2d.gd` | Planet orbit ellipse + time markers. Samples `@export` elements directly (no derive-from-state wobble). |
| `scripts/planet.gd` | Closed-form orbit body around the sun. `apply_visual()` + `spawn_dynamic_children()` called explicitly by `level_loader` after `@export` setup. |
| `scripts/rocket.gd` | Player — thrust, rotation, gravity, landing/crash (decides via `is_landable` flag on nearest attractor), `_snap_to_home_planet` (deferred via `call_deferred`). Game-wide physics in `@export`s. `min_visual_scale` keeps on-screen size constant. |
| `scripts/sun.gd` | Sun: `mass` + `radius` (collision + visual disk, single source of truth) + `is_landable = false` (instant crash on contact). Exposes `velocity: Vector2 = Vector2.ZERO` for parity with other attractors. |
| `scripts/sunpolygon_2d.gd` | Sun visual (procedural polygon) |
| `scripts/asteroid.gd` | Closed-form orbit body around the sun, `mass = 0` by default (obstacle, no gravity). Default `is_landable = false`. Same `apply_visual()` + `spawn_dynamic_children()` pattern as planet. |
| `scripts/moon.gd` | Closed-form orbit body around its parent planet (scene-tree child, no name lookup). `resolve_orbit()` and `_physics_process` offset orbit distance by `parent.radius` so the JSON's `perihelion`/`aphelion` are surface-relative. Same `apply_visual()` + `spawn_dynamic_children()` pattern as planet. Default `is_landable = true`. |
| `scripts/astronaut.gd` | Rescue target (auto-spawned by planet/moon `spawn_dynamic_children()` if `has_astronaut = true`) |

## Known Issues & TODOs

> Updated 2026-07-07 after Phase 4 inspector + launch-from-menu + four
> bug fixes in `3b36cbc` (sun visual, sun position lock, degrees in
> inspector, inspector scroll). Editor work paused awaiting your
> verification of that commit. Sections below are sequenced; items
> within a section aren't strict priority — mix and match.

### 1. Verify last commit (`3b36cbc`) — do this first, unverified
- Sun radius drags live (visual disk grows/shrinks with edits)
- Sun has no Position field in inspector
- Angle of Aphelion + Phase show `°` suffix and accept degrees
- Body list stays visible after Add Moon (ScrollContainer fix)
- If anything regresses, note the exact symptom and we'll dig in

### 2. Level editor — make it actually useful (active work)
- **Phase 6: Test Level** — "play what I just made" button. Loads current spec into the game scene. Closes the edit → play loop.
- **Phase 5: Pan + Zoom** — bodies at perihelion 9000 are off-screen at the fixed zoom. WASD pan + scroll zoom on the SubViewport Camera2D.
- **Phase 6: Save / Save As + Load** — write spec to JSON. You'll want Load within one session of Save.
- **Editor return path** — currently no way back to the main menu. Esc → confirm dialog.

### 3. Game-side polish (independent of editor)
- **Multi-astronaut rescue** — 2-3 levels where one trip isn't enough
- **Asteroid belt** — at least one level using asteroids as a deliberate "thread the needle" course (asteroids are implemented, but no level uses them that way yet)
- **Faster time warp** — extend `TIME_WARP_LEVELS` from `[1, 2, 4, 8]` to include 16× and 32×
- **Crash/landing speed tuning** — playtest the 80/150 defaults (untested per the old doc)
- **Fuel economy** — no in-transit refueling; asteroids support `has_fuel` for risk/reward near rocks, no level uses it yet

### 4. Cleanup (cheap)
- Delete `scenes/level_01.tscn` — stale, untracked, unreferenced (project uses `scenes/level.tscn`; the only references are in `.godot/editor/` metadata which is gitignored)
- Decide `.uid` tracking policy — keep tracking vs move to `.gitignore`
- Rename `PlanetContainer` → `BodyContainer`? Cosmetic; holds planets + asteroids

### 5. Game polish backlog (longer-term, your call)
- More levels (currently 3; need rising-difficulty progression)
- How-To-Play content (currently placeholder text)
- Visual feedback on crash / successful pickup
- Replace procedural `Polygon2D` circles with sprites
- Win / lose music
- Tune fuel consumption / thrust defaults

### 6. Out of scope (currently — not shipping Astro-Rescue per your 2026-07-07 steer)
Multiple rocket types, difficulty modes, achievements, leaderboards, Steam release. Kept here for posterity, not on the roadmap. Revisit if/when "release" enters scope.

## Working Notes

- **Project root:** `rocketman/astrorescue-main/rocketman/`
- **Git:** 24 commits ahead of origin/main, working tree dirty: untracked `scenes/level_01.tscn` (stale, see Cleanup #4). Not pushed (testing first).
- **Init-order lesson (now repeated across multiple scripts):** Whenever a script attaches to a scene where a sibling or cousin populates a group / sets `@export`s later, defer or lazy-init. Three flavors seen across the refactor and body-type expansion:
  - `add_child` first, then call a method that reads now-set `@export`s — `1302eb9` (`apply_visual` + `spawn_dynamic_children`), reused in `700a40b` for moon + asteroid.
  - Lazy retry in `_process` until the resource appears — `7931e51` (`sun = _find_sun()`) and `c3e4541` (the "same pattern" trajectory-side note).
  - `call_deferred` for self-contained setup that has to wait for siblings — `4908453` (`_snap_to_home_planet`).
- **Property-contract parity across body types:** When a new body type joins `"attractors"`, it must declare every property other code reads unconditionally on attractors — even properties the new body doesn't physically need. `var velocity: Vector2 = Vector2.ZERO` on the sun is the canonical example (`32e3847`); without it, HUD/rocket/trajectory/moon code's `Vector2(body.get("velocity"))` crashed the first time the rocket got near the sun.
- **Body identification: `body_label` not `body.name`:** Scene-tree name (`body.name`) is the scene's internal identifier (always `"planet"` from `scenes/planet.tscn`). JSON's `"name"` key flows into a `body_label` @export via the loader. When looking up by JSON name, always match `body.get("body_label")`, never `body.name` (see `68bb4ba`). **The moon refactor obsoletes this rule for moons** — moons no longer look up by name, they use `get_parent()`. The rule still applies anywhere you do need to find a named body (e.g., future code that resolves targets by name).
- **Subordinate bodies as scene-tree children:** When a body is conceptually subordinate to another (moon → planet, satellite → ship, projectile → launcher), make it a scene-tree child. The relationship becomes `get_parent()`, robust by construction. This obsoletes string-name lookups (and the `body_label`-vs-`body.name` pitfall above) and mirrors the JSON hierarchy. Pattern from the moon refactor — see `scripts/moon.gd` header and `_instantiate_planet_moon` in `scripts/level_loader.gd`.
- **Commenting standard:** `##` above every `@export` (inspector tooltips) + every function; `#` for inline `why` comments. Per godot-best-practices skill §2.2.
- **Indentation:** Tabs only, displayed 4-wide. Match existing file style when editing.
- **Process:** When making non-trivial changes, do them as a complete phase (commit per stage). Don't batch multiple phases. Jason prefers "check in occasionally."
